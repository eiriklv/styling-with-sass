* The experts seem capable at coining good ideas, but then incapable of explaining the nuances behind them. Mobile first became a mantra to such an absurd point that it's nearly impossible having a discussion about design, UX, or CSS even where if you don't open with that, everyone thinks you have no idea what you're talking about.
